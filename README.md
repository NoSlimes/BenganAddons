# BenganAddons

Bengan Addons is a combination of unity prefabs and scripts to make game development easier and less time consuming.

Currently it contains a new way of saving data between sessions, named BenganPrefs. Benganprefs has built in ways to automatically encrypt files, manage different files and saving even lists of data between sessions.
There is also a volume manager script which you quickly can drag into your script and get working so you dont have to do all of that yourself.
