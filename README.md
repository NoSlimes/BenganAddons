# BenganAddons

Bengan Addons is a combination of unity prefabs and scripts to make game development easier and less time consuming.

Currently it contains a new way of saving data between sessions, named BenganPrefs. Benganprefs has built in ways to automatically encrypt files, read other files and saving lists between sessions. There is also a benganmono script which helps to create a singleton quicly.
There is also a volume manager script which you quickly can drag into your script and get working so you dont have to do all of that yourself.
